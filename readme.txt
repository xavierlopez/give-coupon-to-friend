Automatically generates a coupon to give to a friend when order is completed in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Automatically generates a coupon to give to a friend when order is completed in WooCommerce (sort of a digital word-of-mouth).
The coupon cannot be used by the person who ordered so it must be given to a friend.
The value of the coupon is the same as the order that generated it. 
I'm open to add customizations if you ask. Please email me at: xavierlopezdev@gmail.com
